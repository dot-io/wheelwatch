# WheelWatch

This is the repository for the WheelWatch website, a mock company that wants to produce a car detection system for authorities -- and potentially for private companies -- to prevent car theft and other kinds of fraud.
For this project we have used Bootstrap alongside HTML, and added some minor custom CSS where necessary.
